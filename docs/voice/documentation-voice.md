# Documentation Voice Guide

## Purpose

This guide defines voice, structure, and quality standards for **Documentation** content in Signal Forge. Use this when generating task guides, tutorials, references, and explanations.

**Critical distinction**: Documentation is **clear, reader-focused, and matched to one job**. A tutorial helps someone learn, a guide helps someone complete a task, a reference helps someone look up exact information, and an explanation helps someone understand how or why. Do not force all four into one universal document structure.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Lead with What the User Needs

**Thought Leadership**: Opens with tension, questions, exploration
**Architecture**: Opens with decisions and facts
**Documentation**: Opens with what the user will accomplish

```markdown
❌ "There's a fascinating tension in how tools evolve to serve multiple audiences..."

❌ "The system implements a multi-mode content generation architecture based on..."

✅ "This guide shows you how to generate professional content from meeting notes in under 5 minutes."
```

### 2. Be Direct and Instructional

**Thought Leadership**: Provisional ("Here's where I've landed—for now")
**Architecture**: Authoritative ("The system uses...")
**Documentation**: Imperative and clear ("Run this command...")

```markdown
❌ "I think you might want to consider running the generate command."

❌ "The CLI interface provides a generate subcommand that accepts input parameters."

✅ "Run `forge generate deck --input notes.md` to create a presentation."
```

### 3. Use Numbered Steps for Procedures

**Thought Leadership**: Narrative flow with intentional fragments
**Architecture**: Complete technical specifications
**Procedural documentation**: Numbered, scannable steps. References and explanations do not need artificial step sequences.

```markdown
❌ "First you'll want to install. Then configure. Finally, run."

❌ "Installation requires npm package manager execution followed by environment configuration."

✅
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Copy the environment template: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Add your API keys to `.env`
4. Run your first command: `forge generate deck --input notes.md`
```

### 4. Use Tables for Comparable Reference Data

When readers need to compare options, commands, or configurations, use a table. Do not turn an explanation into a table when sequence or causality matters more than comparison.

```markdown
❌ The format option accepts pptx for PowerPoint, docx for Word documents, pdf for PDF files, and html for web pages.

✅
| Format | Output | Use Case |
|--------|--------|----------|
| pptx | PowerPoint | Presentations |
| docx | Word | Editable documents |
| pdf | PDF | Final distribution |
| html | Web page | Interactive viewing |
```

### 5. Show Before You Tell When an Example Carries the Idea

For commands and concrete usage, lead with an example and then explain it. For conceptual explanations, lead with the conclusion or mental model instead.

```markdown
❌ "The --mode flag overrides automatic mode detection and forces a specific content mode."

✅
```bash
forge generate deck --input notes.md --mode architecture
```
Use `--mode` to override automatic detection when your content needs a specific voice.
```

### 6. Make Executable Documentation Copy-Paste Ready

Commands and code should be copy-paste ready. Do not add code blocks to a reader job that does not require code.

```markdown
❌ Run the forge generate command with deck as the type and your input file.

✅
```bash
forge generate deck --input meeting-recap.md
```
```

## Document Structure

### Task Guide Structure

1. **Outcome** - What the reader will accomplish
2. **Before you start** - Only the prerequisites that actually apply
3. **Steps** - The shortest safe path through the task
4. **Verify** - How to recognize success
5. **Recovery or next step** - Only when the task has a likely failure or continuation

### Tutorial Structure

1. **Goal** - What you'll build/accomplish
2. **Prerequisites** - What you need before starting
3. **Steps** - Numbered, detailed steps
4. **Verification** - How to confirm success
5. **Next Steps** - Where to go from here

### Quick Reference Structure

1. **Commands** - All commands with brief descriptions
2. **Options** - Table of all options
3. **Examples** - Common command patterns when they reduce lookup time
4. **Failure meanings** - Only errors the reader is likely to encounter

### Explanation Structure

1. **Conclusion** - The idea the reader should leave with
2. **Mental model** - The smallest model that makes the behavior predictable
3. **How the parts relate** - Sequence, cause, constraints, or tradeoffs
4. **Concrete example** - When it helps test the model
5. **Implication** - What the reader should understand or decide differently

## Voice Characteristics

### DO

- **Use active voice**: "Run the command" not "The command should be run"
- **Use second person**: "You can configure..." not "Users can configure..."
- **Be specific**: "Add your API key" not "Configure authentication"
- **Use present tense**: "This creates a file" not "This will create a file"
- **Include expected output**: Show what success looks like

### DON'T

- **No questions or tension**: This isn't thought leadership
- **No unearned technical depth**: Match detail to the declared reader and job
- **No provisional language**: "You might want to..." → "To do this..."
- **No jargon without explanation**: Define terms on first use
- **No walls of text**: Break up content with headers, bullets, code blocks

## Quality Checklist

### Before Generating Documentation

- [ ] Clear target audience identified
- [ ] Purpose of document defined
- [ ] Key tasks/features to cover listed
- [ ] Examples and code snippets planned

### Documentation Quality Indicators

- [ ] Opens with user benefit, not feature description
- [ ] Procedures use numbered steps; non-procedural documents are not forced into them
- [ ] Executable examples are copy-paste ready
- [ ] Tables are used where readers compare or look up values
- [ ] No provisional or exploratory language
- [ ] Expected outputs shown where relevant
- [ ] Recovery guidance is included when a likely failure mode warrants it

## Examples by Type

### Good User Guide Opening

```markdown
## Signal Forge User Guide

Signal Forge transforms rough notes into polished professional content.
Feed it meeting recaps, get back presentation decks.
This guide covers installation, configuration, and daily usage.

### Quick Start

1. Install: `npm install`
2. Configure: `cp .env.example .env` and add your API keys
3. Generate: `forge generate deck --input notes.md`

Your first deck is ready in `output/decks/`.
```

### Good Tutorial Opening

```markdown
## Tutorial: Creating Your First Strategy Deck

**Goal**: Turn meeting notes into a professional presentation in 5 minutes.

**Prerequisites**:
- Signal Forge installed
- API key configured
- Meeting notes in a markdown file

### Step 1: Prepare Your Input
...
```

### Good Quick Reference Entry

```markdown
## Content Types

| Type | Mode | Best For |
|------|------|----------|
| deck | Advisory | Client presentations |
| pov | Thought Leadership | Opinion pieces |
| architecture | Architecture | System designs |

### Generate a Deck

```bash
forge generate deck --input recap.md --format pptx,html
```
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't Do This

```markdown
❌ "I've been thinking about how to explain Signal Forge, and here's where I've landed..."

❌ "There's a tension between simplicity and power in CLI tools..."

❌ "The system implements a sophisticated multi-provider architecture leveraging..."

❌ "You might want to consider running the installation script, though there are other approaches you could explore depending on your specific situation..."
```

### Do This Instead

```markdown
✅ "Signal Forge generates professional content from your notes. Here's how to get started."

✅ "Run `npm install` to install dependencies."

✅ "Three content modes are available: thought-leadership, architecture, and advisory."
```
